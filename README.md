## Installation

#### Required libraries:
* [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php)
* [SDL2_Image](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/)
* [SDL2_TTF](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/)
* [SDL2_GFX](http://cms.ferzkopp.net/index.php/software/13-sdl-gfx)
* [SDL2_MIXER](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/)

#### Required system variables:
* SDL2_PATH
* SDL2_IMAGE_PATH
* SDL2_TTF_PATH
* SDL2_GFX_PATH
* SDL2_MIXER_PATH

SDL2_GFX_PATH is special because you have to build the libraries from source, and then create a folder that contains the folders "include" and "lib" and put *.lib/*.dll in the lib folder and the header files in the include folder.
